            <p>
                I'm a frontend web developer currently putting a lot of effort into learning more about the technologies I use while also giving enough attention to the so-called soft skills such as project management, agility, teamwork among others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm always in search for good practices in the languages I use, tech trends and UX design concepts, and I try applying those in the projects I work in. I'm willing to become a developer with an eye toward UX and UI design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Me as a part of the tech industry can't think of not making sure that everything I do takes along bits of my own essence, considering that the innovation comes from the human part of everyone. I believe that since I was born I knew that whatever path I chose to follow, it'd be something related to the art of "creation" and the most valuable opportunity I benefit from being a developer is the opportunity to release creativity.
